You can receive a `reactFlowInstance` by using the `onLoad` callback:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactFlow from 'react-flow-renderer';

const onLoad = (reactFlowInstance) => {
  reactFlowInstance.fitView();
}

const BasicFlow = () => <ReactFlow onLoad={onLoad} elements={[]} />;
```

`reactFlowInstance` has the following functions:

### project

Transforms pixel coordinates to the internal ReactFlow coordinate system.
This can be used when you drag nodes (from a side bar for example) and need the position on the pane.

`project = (position: XYPosition): XYPosition`

### fitView

Fits view port so that all nodes are inside the view port.

`fitView = ({ padding }): void`

### zoomIn

`zoomIn = (): void`

### zoomOut

`zoomOut = (): void`

### zoomTo

`zoomTo = (zoomLevel: number): void`

### getElements

`getElements = (): Elements`

### setTransform

Sets position and zoom of the pane.

`setTransform = (transform: FlowTransform): void`
