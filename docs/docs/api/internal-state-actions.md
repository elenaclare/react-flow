title: Internal State and Actions

Under the hood React Flow uses [Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.now.sh/) for state handling.
If you need to access the internal state you can use the `useStoreState` hook inside a child component of the `ReactFlow` component:

### Internal state

```jsx
import ReactFlow, { useStoreState } from 'react-flow-renderer';

const NodesDebugger = () => {
  const nodes = useStoreState(state => state.nodes);

  console.log(nodes);

  return null;
}

const Flow = () => (
  <ReactFlow elements={elements}>
    <NodesDebugger />
  </ReactFlow>
);
```

### Internal actions

You will not need this in most cases but you can also use the internal actions that are defined in the [store](/src/store/index.ts):

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useStoreActions } from 'react-flow-renderer'

const TransformUpdater = ({ x, y, zoom }) => {
  const setTransform = useStoreActions(actions => actions.setInitTransform);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTransform({ x, y, k: zoom })
  }, [x, y, zoom]);

  return null;
});
```

If you need more control you can wrap the `ReactFlow` component with the `ReactFlowProvider` component in order to be able to call `useStoreState` and `useStoreActions` outside of the `ReactFlow` component.
